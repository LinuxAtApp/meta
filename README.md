Repo for organizing meetings and general discussion.

# How to use this repo
Each issue is a discussion topic. If you can't find an issue relevant
to your needs, create a new one. There should be an issue for each
group meeting.

## Meeting Issues
This is the place to request things that you want to do during a meeting.
Things like:
 - I want food from *restaurant*
 - I would like a workshop on *tool*
 - I have a really cool *thing* to demo
 
## Discussion Issues
You can open one of these to ask questions about anything Linux. Please
provide links to any resources that you reference.
